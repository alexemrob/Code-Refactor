<h1>01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor</h1>
<p>
The purpose of this homework assignment was to gain front-end developer experience. By refactoring an existing code to implement new technology and meet a certain set of standards, the webpage became more accessible.
The refactored webpage has semantic HTML elements, accessible alt attributes, a concise, descriptive title, heading attributes that fall in sequential order, and it follows a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
